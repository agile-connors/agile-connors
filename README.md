## Product Design

### Product Name

Boston Scavenger

### Far Vision

Demystify food trucks worldwide, enhancing the experience with some best practices from restaurants like: where and when to find them, how to get them to your neighborhood, and ordering ahead to earn points.

### Near Vision

Provide people local to Boston with up-to-date information about good, transient food sources nearby.

### Tag Line

*Sometimes your schedule makes finding food hard. If only there was a way you could find good, interesting food trucks close by... Soon you can with Boston Scavenger!*

### Stakeholders

- Local college students *(Danielle Alexandrine Madriaga)*
- Local working adults
- Food truck owners and operators

#### User Persona

![Danielle Madriaga](user-persona.png)<br />
**Name:** Danielle Alexandrine Madriaga<br />
**Age:** 19<br />
**Occupation:** Student<br />
**Interests:** Traveling, singing, eating<br />
**Description:** Danielle is a Harvard Summer School student and has class from 6:30 - 9:30 pm. Because Cabot Dining Hall dinner closes at 7:15 PM, she can never have dinner. Danielle also likes to eat local food at food trucks, but has trouble finding trucks nearby when her class is over.

## Product Backlog

The product backlog is maintained using Trello and is publicly accessible [here](https://trello.com/b/sfmmsg8h/agile-connors).

### Backlog Sizing

Backlog items were initially sized using relative mass valuation. Team members collaborated to order all existing backlog items from smallest to largest. These items were then organized into groups of similar size and story points were assigned based on these groups.

*Note: Only development team members participated in sizing backlog items.*

### Backlog Order

The rationale behind the initial ordering of the product backlog is primarily based on dependencies. The product has somewhat of a technical prerequisite in that it needs to display a geographic map and consume data from an existing API. Most of the product features depend on this base functionality existing.

Additionally, backlog items are generally prioritized higher if they are known to be more feasible. For example, product features that utilize data that definitely exists in the API we plan to use are prioritized higher.

Otherwise, features are examined for effort vs. impact and prioritized accordingly. This means that the implementation complexity is compared to how far the feature moves the product toward the product vision.

### Definition of Ready

- [ ] The backlog item has a **title**.
- [ ] The backlog item has a **user story sentence**.
- [ ] The backlog item has **one or more acceptance criteria**.
- [ ] The backlog item is **estimated in story points** and is **5 points or less**.
- [ ] The backlog item has any **additional details** needed to understand the requirements.
